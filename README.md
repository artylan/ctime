# ctime

This little app is an equivalent for the Linux command "time" for windows. 
You can use it to display timings for another apps.

Usage: ctime program.exe [args]

Output:

Real 00:00:03.3660589

User 00:00:26.4531250

Sys  00:00:00.0625000

Here you can see, that program.exe needed 3.36 seconds to complete, 
but has used about 26.45 seconds user time! This app must have used 
about 8 cores in the same time to make its computation.
